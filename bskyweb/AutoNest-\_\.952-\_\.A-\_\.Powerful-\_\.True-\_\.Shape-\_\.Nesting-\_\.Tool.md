# AutoNest 9.5.2: A Powerful True Shape Nesting Tool
 
AutoNest 9.5.2 is a software program that can help you optimize the use of sheet material for cutting and punching machines. It can create efficient and complex solutions for your parts, taking into account part attributes and your preferences. You can import your parts from various file formats, such as DXF, DWG, etc., and AutoNest will automatically arrange them on your sheets according to material and thickness. You can also manually adjust the parts on your sheets if you want. AutoNest can generate NC codes for the resulting nesting solution, simulate it, create detailed production reports, and send your daily job/order to production.

AutoNest 9.5.2 is a crack version of AutoNest that has been patched to bypass the license verification. It is available for download from some websites, such as [^1^] and [^2^], but it is not recommended to use it as it may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer or compromise your data. It is also illegal to use a cracked version of a software program without paying for it.
 
If you are interested in AutoNest and want to try it out, you should visit the official website of the software developer and request a demo or a trial version. Some of the developers of AutoNest are Metalix CAD/CAM Sheet Metal Software[^3^], SigmaNEST[^4^], CAD Studio[^5^], and Radan Systems[^6^]. They offer different features and packages for different types of machines and industries.
 
AutoNest 9.5.2 is a powerful true shape nesting tool that can help you save time and money by reducing material wastage and machine time. However, you should avoid using a cracked version of it and instead opt for a legitimate one from the official website of the software developer.

Here are some more paragraphs for the article:
 
What is true shape nesting? True shape nesting is a technique that involves placing irregular shapes on a sheet of material in such a way that minimizes the gaps and overlaps between them. This way, the material utilization is maximized and the scrap is minimized. True shape nesting can be done manually or automatically using software programs like AutoNest.
 
Why is true shape nesting important? True shape nesting is important for many industries that use cutting and punching machines to produce parts from sheet materials. These industries include shipbuilding, heavy engineering, synthetic leather/fabric goods, and furniture manufacture. By using true shape nesting, these industries can reduce their material costs, improve their production efficiency, and lower their environmental impact.
 
How does AutoNest work? AutoNest works by using a range of versatile methods for the best possible automatic and manual nesting. It can recognize the patterns of your parts and batch process them according to your machine type. It can also take into account part attributes and your preferences, such as common cuts, hole filling, remnant management, collision-less mode, etc. It can create multiple sheet solutions for different materials and thicknesses. It can also generate NC codes for the resulting nesting solution, simulate it, create detailed production reports, and send your daily job/order to production.
