Deep English is a course that uses a method called "active listening" to help you learn English naturally and effortlessly. Active listening means that you listen to stories and articles that are interesting and relevant to you, and then you repeat them out loud or answer questions about them. This way, you train your ears to understand native speakers, and your mouth to speak like them.
 
Deep English has two main products: the True Stories Fluency Course and the Daily English Listening Program. The True Stories Fluency Course consists of 30 stories based on real events that are inspiring and motivational. Each story comes with three versions: slow, normal, and fast. You also get vocabulary lessons, grammar lessons, quizzes, and speaking exercises for each story. The Daily English Listening Program gives you access to hundreds of short articles on various topics that are updated every week. You can listen to them online or download them as mp3 files.
